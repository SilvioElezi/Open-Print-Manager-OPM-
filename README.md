# Open Print Manager (OPM)

**Vision:**  
An open-source print management suite for mixed environments (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android). Built on top of [CUPS](https://openprinting.github.io/cups/) and [OpenPrinting](https://openprinting.github.io/), with features for quotas, reporting, and secure pull-printing â€” free from vendor lock-in.

---

## Why?
Commercial print management software is expensive, closed-source, and often tied to specific vendors.  
Our goal: **a fully open-source, sustainable alternative** that organizations (schools, NGOs, businesses) can deploy on standard Linux servers.

---

## Project Goals
- âœ… Centralized print server on **Ubuntu LTS** using **CUPS**  
- âœ… Support for **driverless printing (IPP Everywhere, AirPrint, Mopria)**  
- âœ… Legacy printer support via **Gutenprint** and **OpenPrinting Printer Applications**  
- ðŸš§ Quotas & accounting via **PyKota** (revived & modernized)  
- ðŸš§ Web UI for **pull-print / secure release**  
- ðŸš§ Integration with **LDAP / Active Directory** for authentication  
- ðŸš§ Reporting & monitoring (usage, costs, per-user stats)
